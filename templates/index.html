			<h1>About Me.</h1>
			<section id="main2">

				<p>I am an M.A.Sc candidate at <a href="https://carleton.ca/" target="blank">Carleton University</a> under the guidance of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Giy-AmwAAAAJ" target="blank">Dr.Rafik Goubran</a>. My work is supported in part by the <a href="https://agewell-nce.ca/" target="blank">AGE-WELL NCE Inc</a> and National Innovation hub program, <a href="https://www.bruyere.org/en/bruyere-research-institute" target="blank">Bruyère Research Institute</a> New Investigator Grant, in part by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) grant and by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) Discovery Grant. My research at Carleton focuses on assisting the lives of older adults in a Smart Home setting by calculating important health measures unobtrusively. My reasearch interests lie in Signal Processing, Image Processing, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I completed my Bachelors of Technology in Electronics and Communication from Amity University, India, where I was an undergraduate Research Assistant in <a href="https://www.amity.edu/aset/departments-ece-Research-Cells-ece-Signal.asp" target="blank">Signal and Image Processing lab</a> under the guidance of <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=UZYa1C0AAAAJ&hl=en" target="blank">Dr.M.K.Dutta</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=8PHD6WgAAAAJ&hl=en" target="blank">Prof.M.Partha Sarathi.</a></p><br>

Maximum and guided filters are used to extract the illumination information. Results obtained from proposed methodology has proved that this method reduced the computation complexity significantly whilst achieving better visual quality than state-of-the-art methods. Algorithm used in this project is a MATLAB implementation of <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8803591" target="blank">this paper</a>.</p></section></div></li>
